# HangmanGUI

**NOTE: This project is a WIP**

This is an adaptation of my previous Hangman game, this is built in Phython3. To make this program run in a GUI I have used the recently incorporate module TKinter that is now avalible in the standard library (3.7.1). Just like my older program it emcompasses an approximate 29,343 words which essentially makes up ~17.190311% of all words in the english dictionary. I have pulled these from a censored wordlist but I am not accountable for you reading some naughty words should some have fallen through the cracks.
